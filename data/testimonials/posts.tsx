Throughout the course, we acquired knowledge in various areas, such as setting up Jenkins on Amazon EKS using Kubernetes Operators and Helm charts. I want to extend my gratitude to Mr. Vimal Daga for sharing his expertise and making the masterclass a truly exceptional learning experience. One of the highlights was our exploration of managing Jenkins pipelines as code, employing tools like Jenkins Kubernetes CRD and Grafana Loki. What's remarkable is that we completed a full-fledged DevOps project within a condensed 3-hour session, which is a testament to Mr. Vimal Daga's exceptional teaching`,

    The workshop was incredibly beneficial! I'm excited about the practical applications of CI/CD and AWS services. I plan to start by working on a personal project to implement a deployment pipeline and use AWS CodeDeploy for automation. Collaborating with others will definitely enhance the learning experience, and I'm eager to stay updated with new DevOps trends to improve my skills continuously.
    I'm really looking forward to applying these insights!
